# calc
This is a calc (that's slang for calculator btw) for the last project of the Foundations course in the Odin Project

## ideas to make this better (prolly not going to implement this)
make it on a beautiful setting with mountains, and the buttons are made of rock and either in a rock or slightly 3D, and then also have the numbers pop up behind the mountains, such as if they were literally appearing in the sky in the background.
