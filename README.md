# calc
This is a calc (that's slang for calculator btw) for the last project of the Foundations course in the Odin Project

### ideas to make this better (prolly not going to implement this)
make it on a beautiful setting with mountains, and the buttons are made of rock and either in a rock or slightly 3D, and then also have the numbers pop up behind the mountains, such as if they were literally appearing in the sky in the background. 

### colors used (from [coolors.co](coolors.co))

- #401F29 - purple
- #9C8F76 - beaver 
- #F3C99C - sunset
- #E3874E - orange
